# i. Is there a relationship between the predictors and the response?
# There is a relationship between predictors and the response. In particular, the F statistic
# is very significant suggesting that you reject the idea that there is no relationship
# between the predictors and the response.
#
# ii. Which predictors appear to have a statistically significant relationship to the response?
# Displacement, weight, acceleration, year and origin all have statistically significant 
# p-values suggesting that they have a significant relationship to the response.
#
# iii. What does the coefficient for the year variable suggest?
# The coefficients for year and horsepower suggest strong positive relationships between
# the year and horsepower of the vehicle and the response. In simialr fashion, 
# the weight of the vehicle is strongly negatively related to the response. Acceleration,
# displacement and origin have weaker positive relationships with the response and
# the other variables have non-significant p-values.

# d) Use the plot() function to produce diagnostic plots of the linear regression fit. 
# Comment on any problems you see with the fit.

# had significant p-values were: cylinders:origin, cylinders:year:origin,cylinders:displacement:weight:origin  and cylinders:weight:acceleration:origin. This model could potentially be overfit to the data due to the large number of covariates used.

summary(sq.efficiency.model)
# When the quadratic data is fit, many new variables show statistical significance. This could be related to the polynomial type relationship between the response and several covariates discovered in the exploratory plots. This model has significant cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, year and origin covariates. The Adjusted R square is .70, however, it is not a linear fit so that may not be the best metric for comparison.
